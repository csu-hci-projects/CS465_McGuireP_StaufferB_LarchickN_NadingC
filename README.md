## Project Information

The project will be organized using common GitHub etiquette and version control. Project academic paper will implement LaTeX and be available via the GitHub repo. Information on milestone completion and requirements can be seen below. For this project our group will be using *Unreal Engine*, specifically version X.X.X. Required plugins for the project are **[add here]**.

## ***HW1*** Rubric

### Overview:

This assignment is designed to develop interactive object manipulation using virtual hands
and controllers and implementation of gestures using VR hands. The goal of this
assignment is to get used to the Game Engines and the VR environment.

### Provided Materials:

In this assignment, you have the option to select a game engine of your choice
(Unity/Unreal). Template for Unity and Unreal Game engine is provided within this
assignment which includes a hand and controller setup for basic object interactions.
However, students are not required to use the template and can create the project
independently.

The computers in Lab CSB 225 have both Unity (version 2022.3.40f1) and Unreal Engine
(version 5.3.2) installed. The versions of the provided game engine templates are matched
to that of the lab for those who want to develop the assignment in the lab’s computer.
However, if you prefer to use your own system, you can use any version you want although
the template version remains fixed.

### Controllers and Hands Setup: (25 points)

1. You can either download the provided VR template or create your own using Unity or Unreal.

2. Please ensure that your VR headset is successfully connected to your PC or laptop.

3. When running the project, please complete the setup for the controller and hand tracking.

### Assignment Task **1**: (25 Points)

This task focuses on manipulation of the object within the VR environment using both
hands and the controllers. Students will create a platform and create various small objects
mentioned below and will interact with them. After completing this task students will
understand the basics of object interaction within VR environments. The requirements of
are segregated to different groups so keep that in mind while you are completing your
tasks.

1. #### Platform Creation

    1. **Platform:** A platform (in the form of a table) should be created within the VR environment.

2. #### Object Creation

    1. **Red Block:** A red block should be created and placed on the platform, ensuring that it can be grabbed using a hand or controller

    2. **Blue Block:** A blue block should be created and placed on the platform. This block should not be grabbable; however, when a hand or controller is placed near it, its color should change from blue to white.

    3. **Yellow Block:** A yellow block should be created and placed on the platform. This block should not be grabbable; however, when a hand or controller is placed near it, a sound should be produced.

    4. **Purple Block:**  purple block should be created and placed on the platform. This block should not be grabbable; however, when a hand or controller is placed near it, the block should disappear.

### Assignment Task **2**: (30 Points)

This task focused on gesture recognition using only your hands. In this task, students will
do a hand gesture and that will be displayed within the VR environment, specific
instructions are provided below. After completing this task students will understand how
to implement gestures within VR environments. The requirements of are segregated to
different groups so keep that in mind while you are completing your tasks.

1. #### Gesture Recognition Implementation
    1. **Thumbs Up:** When a thumbs-up gesture is made with a hand, the VR system should recognize the gesture and display a message in the environment indicating either “Right hand thumbs up!” or “Left hand thumbs up!” based on the hand used.

    2. **Fist:** When a fist gesture is made, the VR system should recognize the gesture and display a message indicating either “Right hand fist!” or “Left hand fist!” based on the hand used.

    3. **Custom Gesture:** A custom gesture, such as a peace sign, should be implemented. The VR system should recognize the gesture and display a message indicating either “Right hand Peace Sign!” or “Left hand Peace Sign!” based on the hand used.

### Submission Information:

Creation of a **zip file** named *CS465_McGuireP_StaufferB_LarchickN_NadingC* containing project root directory, must be confirmed functional or points will be lost.

Creation of a **YouTube video** named *DemoVideoHW1* containing a 3-10 minute video demonstrating each task the group completed.
